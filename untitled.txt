My name is Angelina Allen. Although I am a designer for both web and print, I often find myself thinking as an artist. I believe that like great art, a successful design needs a concept that is not only strong but also connects to its audience. Our world is filled with beautiful things and I am striving to add to itâ€™s collection.

My name is Angelina
